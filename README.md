# Admin Commands
Counter-Strike Administrative Commands

This is a Counter-Strike 1.6 server commands, you are required to have the latest build of Counter-Strike 1.6 dedicated server installed on your machine or whatever you are running the server on, and having AMX Mod X 1.8.2 installed on your server.

This plugin may have existed and coded by many other nice and awesome coders, but I have decided to make my own commands plugin, because I like to run my own code on my own servers, and I have decided to post it on GitHub to get suggestions and ideas from the awesome coders out there! :)

The code will be updated regularly on GitHub, as I test it on my own test server! :)
